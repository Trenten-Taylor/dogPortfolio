# Dog Portfolio

## General Info

My second project, created from scratch with no template. It's very simple but it gave me a chance to play around with creating a website with multiple pages, using classes to target specific lines of code to style with CSS, a few animation and hover effects, styling images using CSS, and creating a lightweight nav bar

## Stack
HTML

CSS

## To Do

Make the site responsive on all devices.

Refactor code to make it cleaner/more consistent.

Add in additional pictures of my boys.

Find a way to implement some javascript and add more style to the page.
