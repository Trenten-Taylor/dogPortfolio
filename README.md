This is one of my first projects created using HTML & CSS from scratch. No templates or tutorials were used to create this project. It's simple, but it gave me a chance to play around with what I have learned with CSS and HTML so far including:
Creating a webpage with multiple pages, using classes to target specific lines of code to style with CSS, a few animation and hover effects, styling images using CSS, and creating a nav bar. 
I didn't want to spend too much time on this due to how simple it is so I did not put in any media queries at this time. Later on down the line I will come back and add in Javascript and media queries, but I thought my time would be better suited actually learning Javascript instead of copying something I found on google. 
For the time being, enjoy these photos of my furry friends. More photos will be added along with more code as my coding journey continues!
